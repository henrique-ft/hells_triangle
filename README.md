# HellsTriangle

I choose Haskell because it'Å› a pure functional strongly-typed language and its a very nice choose when you are comming to functional paradigm.

To execute the program you have to use a Linux machine. Follow the steps below:

Clone this repository

` 
$ git clone https://github.com/henriquefernandez/HellsTriangle.git
`

Go to the repository folder

`
$ cd HellsTriangle
`

Execute

`
$ ./HellsTriangle
`

And you are done, Thanks !
