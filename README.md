# HellsTriangle

I choose Haskell because it'Å› a pure functional strongly-typed language and its a very nice choose when you are comming to functional paradigm.

To execute the program you have to use a Linux(Ubuntu 14 or 16) machine. Follow the steps below:

Download Haskell Stack

` 
$ curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
`

Clone this repository

` 
$ git clone https://github.com/henriquefernandez/HellsTriangle.git
`

Go to the repository folder

`
$ cd HellsTriangle
`

Build

`
$ stack build
`

It will install project dependencies and haskell GHC.


Execute

`
$ stack exec HellsTriangle
`

Run tests

`
$ stack test 
`

And you are done, Thanks !
